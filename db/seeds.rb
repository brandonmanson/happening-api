# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# happenings = Happening.create!({name: "Mission Peninsula Extravaganza", start_date: Date.new(2016, 09, 16), end_date: Date.new(2016, 09, 18), user_ids: [1, 2, 3]}, {name: "Thanksgiving Weekend", start_date: Date.new(2016, 11, 24), end_date: Date.new(2016, 11, 26), user_ids: [1, 2, 3]})
